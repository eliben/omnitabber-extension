Omnitabber Chrome extension. **Pre-alpha**.

Scoring algorithm
-----------------

* The search string is converted to lowercase, all non-alphanumeric characters
  are converted to spaces. It is then split by whitespace into an array of
  search words.
* The tab's title and URL are considered. Both are converted to lowercase and
  stripped from all non-alphanumeric characters.
* Each word is matched vs. the title first, and if not found there, vs. the URL.
  If not found in either, score=0.
* If one of the search words is scored=0, the whole match fails.
* Basic scoring - 100 * word_length. I.e. in "foobar", "ooba" matches with
  score=400.
* From this, subtract the match's distance from the beginning of the
  string. For example, in "foobar", "ooba" matches with score=399, while "obar"
  matches with score=398.
* Prefix-matches have a special bonus of 100. So "foob" matches with score=500.
* The score of title matches is multiplied 2x. URL matches are not multiplied.
