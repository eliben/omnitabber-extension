* Why is escape needed? Is it doing the right escaping?
* Do dmenu-like matching instead of regexes.
  * Another potential improvement: match scoring - to show the best on top?
  * If matching is inefficient, maybe it's enough to precompute matches once,
    when the omnibox loads?
* Unit testing: need a way to mock the chrome interfaces?
